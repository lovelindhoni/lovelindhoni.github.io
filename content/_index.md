I am a CS undergraduate at the Chennai Institute of Technology.

I like distributed systems, backends, and anything that requires thinking at scale.

I pay to lift weights, watch films—the fine ones—and read books; I am a voracious reader. I lean more toward Kafka, but lately, I’ve been delving into Dostoevsky.

I have a fish named Olivia.
